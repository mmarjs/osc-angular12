    CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <FONT>Pursuant
    to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who
    provide us with personal information in obtaining products or
    services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to
    request and obtain from us, one time per calendar year, information
    about the customer information we shared, if any, with other
    businesses for their own direct marketing uses. Alternatively, the
    law provides that a company may comply, as Ocean Service does, by
    disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers a choice
    (opt-in or opt-out) regarding sharing Personal Information with third
    parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and
    information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this
    Privacy Policy, Ocean Service provides you choice prior to sharing
    your personal information with third parties for their direct
    marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out
    at the time Ocean Service offers that choice, Ocean Service does not
    share your information with that identified third party for its
    direct marketing purposes.</FONT>
