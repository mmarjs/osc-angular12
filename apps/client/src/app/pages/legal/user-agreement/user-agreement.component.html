  A Service Provider can request disbursement of available funds any

  schedule. If Service Provider does not request a disbursement, Ocean
  Service will automatically disburse available funds no more than 90
  days after the Service Provider Fees are released to the Service

  less than the Minimum Threshold. For purposes of the Terms of

  Providers outside the United States. When the funds in the Service
  Provider Escrow Account are below the Minimum Threshold, the

  request, or (ii) on the first scheduled automatic disbursement

  Account. For Hourly Contracts, Service Provider Fees become available

  and the five-day security period. For Fixed-Price Contracts, the
  Service Provider Fees become available to Service Providers following
  the expiration of the five-day security period after the funds are

  Fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback; (c) we suspect fraud;
  (d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with
  respect to the performance of obligations under this Agreement or
  other Terms of Service; or (e) we deem it necessary in connection
  with any investigation or required by applicable law. If, after

  Ocean Service Escrow to run credit card authorizations on all credit
  cards provided by Owner, to store credit card and banking or other
  financial details as Owner’s method of payment consistent with our
  Privacy Policy, and to charge Owner’s credit card (or any other
  Payment Method) for the Service Provider Fees and any other amounts
  owed under the Terms of Service. To the extent permitted by
  applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and
  agree that we may use certain third-party vendors and service
  providers to process payments and manage your Payment Method
  information. By providing Payment Method information through the Site
  and authorizing payments with the Payment Method, Owner represents,
  warrants, and covenants that: (a) Owner is
  legally authorized to provide such information; (b) Owner is legally
  authorized to make payments using the Payment Method(s); (c) if Owner
  is an employee or agent of a company or person that owns the Payment
  Method, that Owner is authorized by the company or person to use the
  Payment Method to make payments on Ocean Service; (d) such actions do
  not violate the terms and conditions applicable to Owner’s use of
  such Payment Method(s) or applicable law; and (e) any and all
  payments must be made in U.S. Dollars. When Owner authorizes a
  payment using a Payment Method via the Site, Owner represents and
  warrants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to
  complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the
  extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement or the other Terms
  of Service cannot be collected from Owner’s Payment Method(s),
  Owner is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.
  Because the use of any Payment Method may be limited by applicable
  law or by written agreement with your financial institution, Ocean
  Service is not liable to any User if Ocean Service does not complete
  a transaction as a result of any such limit, or if a financial
  institution fails to honor any credit or debit to or from an account
  associated with such Payment Method. Ocean Service will make
  commercially reasonable efforts to work with any such affected Users
  to resolve such transactions in a manner consistent with this
